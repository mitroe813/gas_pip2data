"Addressing the Inspection Selection Challenges of In-Service Pipeline Girth Weld Using Ensemble Tree Models"

## Data Examples in Multiple Formats

This repository contains data examples related to natural gas pipelines, presented in two file formats for accessibility and convenience:

1. **Excel Format (.xlsx)**
2. **CSV Format (.csv)**

### Overview of Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into three primary stages of the natural gas pipeline lifecycle, each with its respective secondary class features.
